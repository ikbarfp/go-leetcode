# [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

- _Example 1:_
> Input: x = 121  
Output: true   
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


- _Example 2:_
> Input: x = -121  
Output: false  
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.  


- _Example 3:_
> Input: x = 10  
Output: false  
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.


## Constraints:
- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
