# [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **_maximum depth_**.

A binary tree's **_maximum depth_** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the 
farthest leaf node.


- _Example 1:_  
![tmp-tree](tmp-tree.jpg)
> Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
Output: 3

- _Example 2:_
> Input: root = [1,null,2]  
Output: 2

## **Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `100` <= `Node.val` <= `100`
